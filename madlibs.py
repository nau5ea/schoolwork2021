"""
This is not an "understandable story," but it is the opening passage from a 
novel by James Joyce, called "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man".

Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down
along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens
little boy named baby tuckoo....

His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass:
    he had a hairy face.

He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived:
    she sold lemon platt.

O, the wild rose blossoms
On the little green place.
He sang that song. That was his song.
